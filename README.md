Macros for Pokemon Legends ZA utilizing an Arduino Leonardo \& [NintendoSwitchControlLibrary](https://github.com/lefmarna/NintendoSwitchControlLibrary/tree/master).



## Requirements

- Arduino Legacy IDE version 1.8.19 (**DO NOT USE VERSION 2.X**)

- Arduino AVR Boards 1.8.3 (downgrade if higher ver.)

- Arduino Leonardo (other boards may work, did not test because i'm broke lol)

- USB connector from board to Nintendo Switch





## Installation


- Please see [this guide](https://pokemonit.com/micon-introduction/) from レフマーナ for setup.

- Upload a script to the Arduino and plug it into the Nintendo Switch dock.



## Features

- BenchAFK: Performs "bench method" for Shiny Pokemon. Initiate after resting at a bench for positioning.

- RestaurantLeNah: Autofarms Restaurant Le Nah to grind battles for the Shiny Charm. Ensure an attacking move is assigned to the A button of your lead Pokemon. Quicker moves like Extreme Speed are optimal. (Might need Canari plush to ensure sufficient money)
